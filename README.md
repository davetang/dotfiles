# dotfiles

Organising my dotfiles.

## What's in a name?

Many of the dotfiles end with _rc_ and this is the historical background:

> [In the context](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RUNCOM) of Unix-like systems, the term rc stands for the phrase "run commands". It is used for any file that contains startup information for a command.
>
> From Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie:[5][6]
>
>     There was a facility that would execute a bunch of commands stored in a file; it was called runcom for "run commands", and the file began to be called "a runcom". rc in Unix is a fossil from that usage.

While _rc_ historically stood for "run commands", most modern _rc_ files function more like configuration files than command scripts.
